I apologize for the confusion. You're right that I didn't provide a separate HTML file. In Vue.js, the HTML is typically integrated into the Vue components using the template section. However, I can provide you with the main HTML file that would typically be used as the entry point for a Vue.js application. This file is usually named index.html and is located in the public folder of a Vue project.

Here's the index.html file:

html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Pulse Configurator</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>


This HTML file is minimal because Vue.js will dynamically render the application content into the <div id="app"></div> element.

The actual HTML content is distributed across the various Vue components I provided earlier. Each component has a <template> section that contains the HTML for that component. For example, in the App.vue file:

vue
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <h1>Pulse configurator</h1>
    <PulseConfigurator />
  </div>
</template>


And in the PulseConfigurator.vue file:

vue
<template>
  <div class="pulse-configurator">
    <div class="tabs">
      <button @click="activeTab = 'workflowMaster'" :class="{ active: activeTab === 'workflowMaster' }">Workflow master</button>
      <button @click="activeTab = 'keyNameMapping'" :class="{ active: activeTab === 'keyNameMapping' }">Key name mapping</button>
      <button @click="activeTab = 'volumeMatrix'" :class="{ active: activeTab === 'volumeMatrix' }">Volume matrix</button>
    </div>

    <WorkflowMaster v-if="activeTab === 'workflowMaster'" />
    <KeyNameMapping v-if="activeTab === 'keyNameMapping'" />
    <VolumeMatrix v-if="activeTab === 'volumeMatrix'" />
  </div>
</template>


These template sections in each Vue component file effectively contain the HTML structure of your application. Vue.js compiles these templates and renders them into the main index.html file at runtime.

If you need a full HTML representation of the entire application structure, you would need to combine all the <template> sections from each component, nesting them appropriately. However, this is not typically how Vue.js applications are structured or developed, as the component-based approach allows for better organization and reusability of code.
